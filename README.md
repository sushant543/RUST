## ðŸ§  Planned Features / TODO

- [ ] Store name and age in memory using `HashMap`
- [ ] Add a `GET /people` route to list stored users
- [ ] Save to JSON file for persistence
- [ ] Add input validation (e.g., name not empty, age > 0)
- [ ] Serve static HTML pages or React frontend
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (Render, Railway, etc.)

## ðŸ“ˆ Learning Goals

This project is part of my journey to learn:

- Backend development in Rust
- Async programming with Tokio
- Building and documenting real-world APIs

### Test with 
```json
{
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/greet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Sanju"}'
}
